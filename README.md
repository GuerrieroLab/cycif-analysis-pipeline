# Image Analysis Workflow

This wiki provides a step-by-step guide for multiplexed image analysis, from raw data to spatial and phenotypic analysis using:

- [MCMICRO](https://mcmicro.org/) for image pre-processing
- [OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/) for ROI selection and annotation
- [Gater](https://github.com/labsyspharm/Gater) for cell-level gating and quality control
- [CycifAnalyzeR](https://github.com/kenichi-shimada/CycifAnalyzeR) for downstream spatial and quantitative analysis
